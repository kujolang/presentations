Repository-backed, local-first workflow kits for the [Kujo programming language](https://kujolang.ai) and its agency and AI tooling ecosystem. Each kit demonstrates one concrete outcome and leaves behind inspectable evidence instead of relying on an opaque hosted runner.

Current release scope: **locally verified support/distribution technical preview** (`0.6.2`). Hosted runners, broad live-provider coverage, clean-machine installation on a separate host, and production or enterprise readiness are not claimed.

## Visual WebOps Reports

[`webops-dashboard/`](webops-dashboard/) is the local SQLite-backed reporting
surface for all ten WebOps workflows and the 28-role WebOps catalog. It imports
run packets without replacing their audit evidence, presents SiteKit tables and
filters, renders Dither Kit charts, and can start bounded `OBSERVE` or `PROPOSE`
website reports from the browser. It never grants `ACT`.

```bash
python3 webops-dashboard/dashboard.py sync
python3 webops-dashboard/dashboard.py serve --open
```

## Publishing House Operator

[`publishing-house-operator/`](publishing-house-operator/) is the durable,
low-touch control loop above the eleven Publishing House workflow kits. It
adds portable publication and voice profiles, SourcePack intake, weekly/monthly/
campaign plans imported into StoryDesk, dependency-aware daily ticks, event
commissioning, exact-version approval routing, checkpoints, leases, exception
notifications, fixture verification, and cron/launchd templates. It reuses the
existing Publishing House tools and authority boundaries instead of creating a
second queue, approval store, evidence system, package system, or publisher.

```bash
publishing-house-operator/bin/publishing-house --json init
publishing-house-operator/bin/publishing-house --json plan import \
  publishing-house-operator/fixtures/september-2026.json
publishing-house-operator/bin/publishing-house --json tick --fixture
```

## VideoOps Production Line

The `videoops-production` initializer packages an arbitrary request for the
VideoOps Producer and emits a prompt that can run in any file-capable agent
harness. Five specialist kits define the file-handoff production line:
creative planning, rights-aware asset resolution, explicit media generation,
HyperFrames editing, and independent critique. Their complete offline gate is
acceptance proof; it is not the content used by a real production.

```bash
videoops-production/bin/run --workspace /absolute/video-workspace \
  --request /absolute/MEGA_PROMPT.md --run-id release-001
bash tests/videoops-release-gate.sh
```

See the [implementation report](docs/videoops/implementation-report.md) for the
verified boundary and the live-provider work that remains external.

## Why Use These Workflows?

- Start from bounded, runnable examples instead of assembling a multi-tool workflow from scratch.
- Use fixture-first paths that are deterministic, local, and safe to evaluate without provider credentials.
- Inspect evidence packets, receipts, reports, and handoffs produced by each workflow.
- Keep host, provider, approval, and security boundaries explicit in both commands and documentation.
- Adapt individual kits without adopting a hosted workflow service.

## Start Here

The portable Loop Engineering demo needs Bash and the files in this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kujolang/kujo-workflows.git
cd kujo-workflows
(cd loop-engineering && bash scripts/run-workflow.sh --demo)
```

Review `loop-engineering/.runs/<timestamp>/SUMMARY.md` after the command finishes.

Most ecosystem demos also require a built Kujo runtime and sibling tool repositories. Keep them under one parent directory and set `KUJO_REPOS`:

```text
/path/to/kujo-repos/
  kujo/
  kujo-skills/
  kujo-workflows/
  casefile/
  dispatch/
  howl/
  mcp/
  rag/
  ...
```

```bash
export KUJO_REPOS=/path/to/kujo-repos
export KUJO_BIN="$KUJO_REPOS/kujo/target/release/kujo"
cd "$KUJO_REPOS/kujo-workflows"
(cd casefile-incident-evidence-packet && bash scripts/run-workflow.sh)
```

Workflow READMEs list any additional runtime, browser, Docker, local-service, or provider requirements. Fixture modes are the default where available; live-provider commands are explicitly opt-in and may incur cost.

## Workflow Catalog

Readiness values come from [`docs/audit/workflow-catalog.json`](docs/audit/workflow-catalog.json):

- **Ready**: production-ready within the documented local contract.
- **Limited**: production-capable with named fixture, provider, host, or approval limitations.
- **Experimental**: useful prototype whose primary path remains under-tested.

### Install Publishing House locally

The eleven Publishing House kits have one locked, tested installation path.
Supply an existing Kujo 1.0.1 binary; the installer uses local sibling
checkouts when available and otherwise clones the exact commits in the install
lock:

```bash
bash scripts/install-publishing-house.sh \
  --prefix "$PWD/.local/publishing-house" \
  --kujo-bin /absolute/path/to/kujo \
  --demo

.local/publishing-house/bin/publishing-house-doctor
.local/publishing-house/bin/publishing-house-demo \
  --out "$PWD/.local/publishing-house/runs/second-run"
```

The installer refuses an existing target, installs into a staging directory,
pins clean dependency checkouts, runs the Kujo-native contract doctor, and can
run the complete eleven-workflow offline proof before reporting success. It
does not install credentials or enable live publication.

## Verification

Run the portable release gates:

```bash
python3 -m pip install jsonschema PyYAML
bash tests/release-readiness.sh
bash tests/clean-checkout.sh
```

The first command validates release metadata, documentation links, catalog structure, contracts, tests, syntax, artifact-ignore coverage, and whitespace. The clean-checkout gate repeats the repository-owned checks from a temporary archive containing only tracked files.

Catalog validation additionally resolves canonical skills and sibling tool repositories:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_catalog.py \
  --skills-root "$KUJO_REPOS/kujo-skills" \
  --tools-root "$KUJO_REPOS" \
  --json
```

Host-dependent representative gates:

```bash
bash workcell-execution-gate/scripts/run.sh
bash tribunal-decision-gate/scripts/run.sh
bash relay-lifecycle-handoff/scripts/run.sh
```

Generated `.runs/`, `.workcell/`, and tool-specific state directories are local evidence. They are ignored unless a deliberately reviewed proof artifact is promoted into a tracked documentation location.

See the current [launch checklist](docs/launch-checklist.md) and [release-readiness Spec](kujo-workflows.spec.yml) for the exact boundary and acceptance contract.

## Release and Support Status

This repository is the MIT-licensed `0.6.2` technical preview of the Kujo workflow-kit distribution. The checkout covers 44 local workflows, including the Owned Agent Project proof, the eleven-workflow Publishing House lifecycle, the Publishing House Operator control layer, the VideoOps production initializer, and the five-stage VideoOps production line, plus shared contracts, documentation, versioned evidence contracts, and repository-owned validation gates. It does not publish a package, container image, hosted runner, or workflow service.

For contribution, support, conduct, and vulnerability-reporting guidance, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md), [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Known Limits

- Some Kujo interpreter runs emit type-checking warnings before successful artifact output; workflow scripts use exit status plus expected artifacts as the contract.
- Live providers, authenticated browser flows, external customer repositories, and hosted execution require separate credentials and approval.
- Tribunal mock decisions are advisory and unsigned.
- Relay proves local persistence and bounded retries, not remote exactly-once delivery.
- Workcell is a trusted local Docker/Podman boundary, not a hosted scheduler or microVM isolation layer.
- The locked Publishing House installer and all-eleven first run pass from a tracked archive on the development host; validation on a physically separate host remains open.

## License

Kujo Workflows is available under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Changes are recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## VideoOps shared media runtime

The media-generation workflow now supports an explicit `--media` production route
for schema-valid generation requests and provider-independent local import. It
executes kujo-agents/videoops/tools/bin/videoops rather than copying provider scripts. Operator scopes,
request fingerprints, budgets, rights evidence and normalized receipts remain
runtime-owned; editing and mixing remain HyperFrames-owned. See
[media generation](videoops-media-generation/README.md). Provider support does not
imply entitlement or live verification; inspect the exact runtime receipts.

[The Workcell gate](workcell-execution-gate/README.md) records the selected daemon's
security signals and uses the supported rootful or rootless workspace identity.
It does not change daemon configuration or waive Workcell security requirements.
